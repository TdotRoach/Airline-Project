Airline-Project
===============

This is a group project that I collaborated on with classmates in my Web Services course at Simmons College.  
The project demonstrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Perl.  I was responsible for:

  -HTML code on page two
  -Perl code to return data entered on page 1 to page 2
  -Small portion of JavaScript validation code
